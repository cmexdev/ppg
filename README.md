# üîë PPG

## Powerful Password Generator

Small password generator "utility" for Windows, Mac, & *possibly* Linux.

There might be some helpful information in the Wiki if we get around to making it.

## ‚ö† Disclaimer

The passwords generated in PPG would take more than 15 hundred million years (according to HSIMP).

Your passwords will never be sent over the internet.

# üì© Updating PPG

First, uninstall PPG.

The uninstall `.exe` can be found in `C:\Program Files (x86)\PGG\unins000.exe`.

Then download the newest version from the releases page.

# üè¢ Usage

Simply start the app. It automatically generates a password on startup. However, it does not copy to clipboard.

**To copy to clipboard**, simply click `Copy`. You should get a notification saying that it was copied.

## "tray mode"

Right-click the tray icon, then hover over `Password` a click `Generate new and copy`. That will generate a new password (cannot be seen until pasted) and copy it to clipboard. It will also send a notification.
